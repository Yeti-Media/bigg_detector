Bigg works quite well, especially if one filters out false positives.
The main issue is scaling: This is an "assymetric feature", that is, only part
of it's total potentil template is even defined (only where gradients are).
Thus, the issue is how to compute a distance metric for this so that fast
nearest neighbor and other techniques may be used for matching?

Some ideas are: Use a Haussdorf metric and/or a hasshing scheme.

FLANN (fast approximate nearest neighbors) has the above issue together with
it doesn't yet (12/11/2010) handle binary features.
